Based on the above results, more available training data points result in a more accurate classifier. However, this improvement
is not linear. Going from 1K data points to 5K increased the accuracy by more than %5, while going from 15K data points to 20K
increased the accuracy only by %0.05. One possible reason might be that 1K data points does not provide sufficient information
to classifier for learning the problem, so more data points will help classifier to accurately classify the data. However, after
observing almost 15K data points, the classifier was able to learn the problem as accurately as it can. More data points will not
help that much as classifier has seen sufficient data points. At this point, to increase the accuracy, the model needs to be 
adjusted. As an intuitive example of such, a linear model can classify a polynomial problem to some extend. No matter how many 
data points are provided, the linear model will never pass the accuracy from a certain point.
